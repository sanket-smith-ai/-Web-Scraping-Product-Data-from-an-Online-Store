##  Web Scraping Product Data from an Online Store (Books to Scrape)

---

## Project Overview

This project is a **Python-based web scraping assignment** that extracts product data from the public website
[https://books.toscrape.com/](https://books.toscrape.com/).

The scraper collects details about books including their **Title**, **Price**, and **Availability** from multiple pages and stores them into a structured CSV file named **`books.csv`**.

## Important Notes

* Do **not** keep `books.csv` open in Excel while running the script ‚Äî it locks the file.
* The script adds a short delay (`time.sleep(1)`) between requests to ensure **polite scraping**.
* Uses only **allowed libraries** ‚Äî no Selenium, APIs, or browser automation.
* You can scrape more pages by updating the variable **`pages_to_scrape`** inside the script.
